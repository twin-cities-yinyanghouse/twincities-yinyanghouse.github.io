    <p>
      The Yin Yang House Twin Cities Acupuncture and Wellness Center is the primary clinic of the Yin Yang House founder, Chad Dupuis.  The clinic strives to offer a wide range of services and educational/training opportunities to encourage long-term (and ideally self-maintained) health and wellness.

    <p class="mt-2">
      The Yin Yang House, through the various clinics and educational outreach arms, has been sharing the wealth of knowledge and techniques within Chinese Medicine and helping people since 1999.  We strive to offer best in class, common sense approaches to help people build and maintain their own health and wellbeing.

      <div class="w-full">
        <p class="m-0">Chad has over 20 years of experience in treating a broad range of conditions, particularly those deemed "difficult to treat".  Voted "best of the best" acupuncturist many years in a row at the clinic he founded in <a href="https://yyhchattanooga.com/">Chattanooga</a> before returning to the midwest.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="m-0">He utilizes a range of techniques tailored to each individual patient but draws heavily from the founder of Tong Ren Therapy, Master Tom Tam, whom he has studied with, worked with, and continues to learn from for nearly 30 years.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="m-0">He is a perpetual student and prolific writer and explorer who shares his knowledge freely through the <a href="https://yinyanghouse.com/">Yin Yang House</a> website.  His site has helped teachers, practitioners, and the general public alike explore the foundations and workings of Chinese Medicine and associated systems.</p>
