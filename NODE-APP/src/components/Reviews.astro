In one visit, my pain was completely gone and has not returned in over a year. I am so happy that I came to find Yin Yang House. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for relief!",

    text: "I have advocated for acupuncture for many years after a friend gave me a gift certificate and I eventually decided to redeem it. I was very reluctant but immediately learned that I was so relaxed and my foot joint pain started going away. Now, as a long time (15 plus years) client, I continue to stay healthy and active. I also pick up an inexpensive Chinese med that is amazing for seasonal allergies! No sinus issues or head aches!",
