## Yin Yang House is opening a New Acupuncture and Wellness Center in the Twin Cities
The Yin Yang House Founder and Chief Acupuncturist, Chad Dupuis, is planning the opening of a new Acupuncture and Wellness Center in the Twin Cities.  Chad has over 20 years of experience in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture, and Tuina and over 30 years of experience in the Tom Tam Healing System/Tong Ren Therapy, Tai Chi/Qigong and Meditation.  

Previously, in the Chattanooga Tennessee clinic that he founded, he was voted "[best of the best acupuncturist](https://gallery.bestofchatt.com/places/view/559/yin_yang_house_acupuncture_and_wellness_center.html)" many years in a row.  He has helped an extremely broad range of conditions that people from all walks of life were experiencing and has extensive experience in "difficult to treat" conditions.  

Why the twin cities?  Well, Chad is a midwesterner by birth and at heart.  He and his wife and two young boys moved to the twin cities in the early 2020's for better public schools, parks, bike paths and midwestern sensibilities - all of the things that make this area a wonderful place to live.  He had semi-retired from acupuncture, but was motivated by previous patients and colleagues to start up a new clinic in the area.  Considering the state of mind and health that many of us are in now, this seems like a good time to establish a helping presence in the area.

At this time, we do not have an opening date yet.  We are still searching for an appropriate location.  We will update when we decide, but hope to open in early 2026.  Looking forward to helping you along your path!
